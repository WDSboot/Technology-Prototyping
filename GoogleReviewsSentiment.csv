Had a CEEG at the Slappoli that was all perfect, friendly help but after that. The communication between neurologist and patient is poor and distant. The neurologist didn't listen, doesn't read the information you give out. If you have any questions, it is difficult via the mail ""melatoninpoli"" and you will receive inadequate information, especially from Thursday. Then they are already in weekend mode. Communicating is not important there apparently, simply the protocol or ""the big book"" is used. The neurologist has learned for it and is far above the patient. For a CEEG you have to go there but otherwise stay away. For the sleeping problems I continued with the GP and we have now come further than in the 2 months that I was with the neurologist. There is also no response to my email when I pass on information to the neurologist. This man still has a lot to learn in that regard. Apparently he is in his final years before retirement. In the first conversation he was touted as the inventor for solving the sleep problem but unfortunately he is a pigeonholed thinker. Apparently he has had his day, time for renewal.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
